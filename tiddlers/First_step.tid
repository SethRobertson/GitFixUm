\define backup(url) [[backup|$url$#backups]]
A git [[choose-your-own-adventure!â“¡|Non Afilliation]]

This document is an attempt to be a fairly comprehensive guide to recovering from what you did not mean to do when using git. It isn't that git is so complicated that you need a large document to take care or your particular problem, it is more that the set of things that you might have done is so large that different techniques are needed depending on exactly what you have done and what you want to have happen.

If you have problems after clicking through this document, please copy-paste the "Path" you took (what links you clicked on, automatically presented to you if javascript is available) when asking for further help, since doing so will explain very precisely what you were trying to do, and that you at least tried to help yourself.

Strongly consider taking a <$macrocall $name="backup" url={{BestPractice!!url}}/> of your current working directory and .git to avoid any possibility of losing data as a result of the use or misuse of these instructions. We promise to laugh at you if you fail to take a backup and regret it later.

Answer the questions posed by clicking the link for that section. A section with no links is a terminal node and you should have solved your problem by completing the suggestions posed by that node (if not, then report the chain of answers you made on #git or some other git resource and explain further why the proposed answer doesn't help). This is not a document to read linearly.
