title: How to undo some uncommitted changes
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

So you have not yet committed and you want to undo some things, well `git status` will tell you exactly what you need to do. For example:

{{SampleGitStatus}}

However, the `git checkout` in file mode is a command that cannot be recovered fromâ€”the changes which are discarded most probably cannot be recovered. Perhaps you should run `git stash save -p "description"` instead, and select the changes you no longer want to be stashed instead of zapping them.
