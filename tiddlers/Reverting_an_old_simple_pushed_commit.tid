title: Reverting an old simple pushed commit
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

To create an positive commit to remove the effects of a simple (non-merge) commit, you must first identify the SHA of the commit you want to revert. {{FindingACommit}}

```sh
git revert SHA
```

Obviously replace "SHA" with the reference you want to revert. If you want to revert multiple SHA, you may specify a range or a list of SHA.
