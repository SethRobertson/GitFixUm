# Git Fix Um

On undoing, fixing, or removing commits in git

## Contributing

1.  Clone this repo.
2.  `npm install`
3.  `npm start`
4.  Edit in browser
5.  Submit a pull request

This starts the TiddlyWiki server. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser
and make edits. They are saved automatically to the repo so you can easily
`git add`/`git commit` them.

## Building

To build the stand alone HTML for publication run `npm run build` and it will
output `wiki-dist/output/index.html`.
